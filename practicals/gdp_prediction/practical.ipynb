    "# Predicting GDP as a function of a country's ruggedness\n",
    "This practical helps you answer a fictitious geographer's questions to you, the data scientist. This practical is based on a paper by [Nunn and Puga, Review of Economics and Statistics, 2012](https://diegopuga.org/research/rugged.pdf). Once you're done with the practical, check out the paper to see how the authors propose to explain the results of their statistical analysis."
