    "# Predicting GDP as a function of a country's ruggedness\n",
    "This practical helps you answer a fictitious geographer's questions to you, the data scientist. This practical is based on a paper by [Nunn and Puga, Review of Economics and Statistics, 2012](https://diegopuga.org/research/rugged.pdf). Once you're done with the practical, check out the paper to see how the authors propose to explain the results of their statistical analysis. The practical is also avalaible at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l9XkjLOWkTmYraGRrhVQG9ty5JlUiDTZ?usp=sharing ."
