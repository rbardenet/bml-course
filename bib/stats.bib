@article{APSS15,
	Abstract = {The basic idea of importance sampling is to use independent samples from one measure in order to approximate expectations with respect to another measure. Understanding how many samples are needed is key to understanding the computational complexity of the method, and hence to understanding when it will be effective and when it will not. It is intuitive that the size of the difference between the measure which is sampled, and the measure against which expectations are to be computed, is key to the computational complexity. An implicit challenge in many of the published works in this area is to find useful quantities which measure this difference in terms of parameters which are pertinent for the practitioner. The subject has attracted substantial interest recently from within a variety of communities. The objective of this paper is to overview and unify the resulting literature in the area by creating an overarching framework. The general setting is studied in some detail, followed by deeper development in the context of Bayesian inverse problems and filtering.},

	Abstract = {{Sparse Gaussian process methods that use inducing variables require the selection of the inducing inputs and the kernel hyperparameters. We introduce a variational formulation for sparse approximations that jointly infers the inducing inputs and the kernel hyperparameters by maximizing a lower bound of the true log marginal likelihood. The key property of this formulation is that the inducing inputs are defined to be variational parameters which are selected by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the variational distribution and the exact posterior distribution over the latent function values. We apply this technique to regression and we compare it with other approaches in the literature.}},
